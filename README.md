# EM5109: Environmental Issues & Sustainability - Comprehensive Study Guide

## Module 1: Foundations of Sustainability
*(Source: Lecture 1)*

### 1. Core Definitions
* Sustainable Development: "Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." (Brundtland Report, 1987) [cite_start][cite: 87, 88].
* The Triple Bottom Line: Sustainability lies at the intersection of:
    * [cite_start]**Environmental:** Conserve resources, protect nature[cite: 76, 77].
    * [cite_start]**Social:** Promote community, eradicate poverty, ensure equality[cite: 80, 81].
    * [cite_start]**Economic:** Financially feasible, long-term management[cite: 82, 83].

### 2. The Daly Rules (Operationalizing Sustainability)
[cite_start]To achieve sustainability, three rules must be met [cite: 94-98]:
1.  Renewable Resources: Must be used no faster than the rate at which they regenerate (e.g., fish, soil).
2.  Non-renewable Resources: Must be used no faster than renewable substitutes can be put into place (e.g., fossil fuels).
3.  Pollution/Waste: Must be emitted no faster than natural systems can absorb, recycle, or render them harmless.

### 3. Key Metrics & Formulas
A. Ecological Footprint (EF)
* [cite_start]**Definition:** Measures the land/water area required to produce consumed resources and absorb generated waste[cite: 230].
* [cite_start]**Unit:** Global Hectare (gha) — a hectare with world average productivity[cite: 255].
* Biocapacity: The capacity of the biosphere to regenerate. [cite_start]If Footprint > Biocapacity = **Ecological Deficit**[cite: 297].

Formulas:
* EF of Consumption ($EF_C$):
    $$EF_C = EF_P + EF_I - EF_E$$
    [cite_start]*Where $EF_P$ is production, $EF_I$ is imports, and $EF_E$ is exports*[cite: 270].

* EF of Production ($EF_P$):
    $$EF_P = \sum \left( \frac{P_i}{Y_{N,i}} \times YF_{N,i} \times EQF_i \right)$$
    * [cite_start]$P_i$: Amount of product harvested[cite: 272].
    * [cite_start]$Y_{N,i}$: National average yield[cite: 274].
    * [cite_start]$YF_{N,i}$: Yield Factor (adjusts for national productivity)[cite: 275].
    * [cite_start]$EQF_i$: Equivalence Factor (adjusts for land type, e.g., Cropland = 2.51)[cite: 277].

* Carbon Footprint ($A$ - Area Calculation):
    Calculates the forest area required to sequester emissions.
    $$A = \frac{P_C \times (1 - S_{Ocean})}{Y_C} \times EQF$$
    * [cite_start]$P_C$: Annual $CO_2$ emissions (tons)[cite: 289].
    * [cite_start]$S_{Ocean}$: Fraction of emissions sequestered by oceans[cite: 289].
    * [cite_start]$Y_C$: Carbon uptake rate per hectare of world average forest[cite: 290].

### 4. Planetary Boundaries
Defines the "safe operating space" for humanity.
* [cite_start]**Critical Overshoots:** Biodiversity Loss (highest risk), Nitrogen Cycle, and Climate Change [cite: 482-491].
* Climate Forcing: The difference between sunlight absorbed by Earth and energy radiated back. [cite_start]Positive forcing (warming) includes $CO_2$ and $CH_4$; negative forcing (cooling) includes Aerosols[cite: 716, 740, 752].

## Module 2: Air Quality, Climate Change & Energy
*(Sources: Lecture 2, Lecture 3)*

### 1. Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) & Climate
* Major GHGs: Water vapor ($H_2O$), Carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), Methane ($CH_4$), Nitrous oxide ($N_2O$), Ozone ($O_3$), and CFCs.
* Global Warming Potential (GWP):
    * Methane ($CH_4$) is ~34x more effective at trapping heat than $CO_2$.
    * Nitrous Oxide ($N_2O$) is ~298x more effective than $CO_2$.
* Mitigation Measures: Energy efficiency (green buildings), renewable energy adoption, Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS), and Bio-fixation (using plants/algae).


### 2. Energy Sustainability
* 1st Law of Thermodynamics: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.
* Renewable Energy Sources:
    * Biomass: 1st Gen (food crops), 2nd Gen (non-edible), 3rd Gen (algae), 4th Gen (GMOs).
    * Solar: Photovoltaics (PV) vs. Solar Thermal (steam generation).
    * Wind: Kinetic energy capture; issues with intermittency and noise.
    * Geothermal: Heat from Earth's crust; reliable baseload but location-specific.
    * Ocean: Wave, Tidal (gravitational), and OTEC (thermal gradient).
    * Nuclear: Fission (current) vs. Fusion (future).

## Module 3: Water Resources & Wastewater
*(Sources: Lecture 5, Lecture 6, Lecture 9)*

### 1. Water Scarcity & Singapore’s Strategy
* Global Context: Only ~2.5% of Earth's water is freshwater. Agriculture is the largest consumer.
* Singapore’s 4 National Taps:
    1.  Local Catchment: Covers 2/3 of Singapore’s land.
    2.  Imported Water: From Johor (agreement ends 2061).
    3.  NEWater: High-grade recycled water (meets 40% demand; target 55% by 2060).
    4.  Desalinated Water: Energy-intensive (target 25% demand by 2060).

### 2. Water Quality & Treatment
* Parameters:
    * *Physical:* Turbidity, Temperature, Color, Taste/Odor.
    * *Chemical:* pH, Hardness, DO, Nutrients (N/P).
    * *Biological:* Pathogens (E. coli, Vibrio cholera, Giardia).
* Potable Treatment: Coagulation $\rightarrow$ Flocculation $\rightarrow$ Sedimentation $\rightarrow$ Filtration $\rightarrow$ Disinfection.
* Wastewater Treatment:
    * *Primary:* Physical removal of solids.
    * *Secondary:* Biological (Activated Sludge, Anaerobic Digestion).
    * *Tertiary:* Membrane filtration (Micro/Ultra/Nano/RO) for reuse.

## Module 4: Pollution & Contaminants
*(Sources: Lecture 4, Lecture 8)*

### 1. Biogeochemical Cycles
* Cycles for Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus maintain ecosystem balance. Disruptions (e.g., fertilizer runoff) lead to eutrophication and dead zones.

### 2. Emerging Contaminants (ECs)
* Definition: Chemicals with unknown long-term risks (pharmaceuticals, personal care products).
* Key Examples:
    * Triclosan: Antibacterial in soap; linked to antibiotic resistance.
    * PFAS/PFOA: "Forever chemicals" in non-stick cookware; persistent/bioaccumulative.
    * Nanomaterials: Particles <100nm; potential for oxidative stress in cells.
    * Endocrine Disruptors (EDCs): Mimic hormones, affecting reproduction (e.g., feminized fish).

## Module 5: Sustainable Waste Management
*(Sources: Lecture 7, Lecture 10, Week 11 Discussion)*

### 1. Circular Economy
* Transition from Linear (Take-Make-Dispose) to Circular (Make-Use-Recycle) to minimize virgin resource extraction.

### 2. Waste-to-Energy (WtE) Technologies
* Incineration: High temp ($850-1100^{\circ}C$). Reduces volume by 90% but produces ash/$CO_2$.
* Pyrolysis: Thermal degradation *without* oxygen ($300-800^{\circ}C$). Produces bio-oil, biochar, syngas. Ideal for plastics.
* Gasification: Partial oxidation ($>700^{\circ}C$). Produces syngas ($CO + H_2$).
* Anaerobic Digestion: Biological breakdown without oxygen. Produces biogas ($CH_4$).

### 3. The Plastic Crisis
* Stats: Only ~9% recycled globally.
* Recycling Methods:
    * *Mechanical:* Grinding/remelting (often leads to downcycling).
    * *Chemical:* Breaking polymers into monomers (e.g., Pyrolysis, Thermo-CVD). Thermo-CVD can turn waste plastic into Hydrogen and Carbon Nanotubes.

## Study Questions for Review
1.  Metric Calculation: Using the Carbon Footprint formula, explain how a decrease in the ocean's sequestration capacity ($S_{Ocean}$) would affect the calculated land area ($A$) required.
2.  Comparison: Compare Pyrolysis and Incineration. Why is Pyrolysis considered better for the "Circular Economy" regarding plastic waste?
3.  Water Security: How does NEWater reduce Singapore's vulnerability to climate change compared to Imported Water?
4.  Policy: Explain the "Daly Rules" and apply them to the current usage of fossil fuels vs. solar energy.
